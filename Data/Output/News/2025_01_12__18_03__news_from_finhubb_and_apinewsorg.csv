Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC, joins Catalysts to discuss this development. O'Donnell characterizes Nvidia's entry into robotics as ""a long-term play,"" noting that ""it won't happen overnight."" He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, ""frankly they were a little too early,"" but suggests their head start with such technology means ""now they're coming in much more strongly."" Highlighting Nvidia's ""Cosmos"" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that ""allows you to do gen AI for physical actions."" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices ""to react and do analog things in the physical world."" He emphasizes its significance, adding, ""That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff."" Drawing a parallel to other tech giants, O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance, ""We think about Microsoft (MSFT) on the Windows side, and we think about Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) on the mobile phone side, and maybe Nvidia becomes sort of the platform for robotics.""

Stifel NextGen transport analyst Stephen Gengaro joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the EV maker amid tariff uncertainties. Gengaro suggests that Trump's proposed tariff policy would have ""wide-ranging"" effects, including reduced competition in US markets — a development that could be ""theoretically a positive"" for Tesla. However, he cautions that the company may face challenges with its international supply chain for parts sourced outside the US. The analyst emphasizes that Tesla is ""more than a car company,"" pointing to initiatives like full self-driving (FSD) technology as ""a huge value driver"" for the stock in the ""medium-to-long term."" He suggests that the potential of these ventures makes the current stock valuation appear ""discounted."" Looking ahead to the Trump administration, Gengaro anticipates more favorable regulations that could accelerate Tesla's initiatives. ""As far as Musk betting on Trump, I think he's clearly engaged in the conversation as far as getting regulation accelerated on the FSD side,"" he explains. ""And that sort of opens the door for just various growth opportunities for the company over time.""
